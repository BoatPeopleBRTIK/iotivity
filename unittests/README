tests.cpp contains unitests for C++ APIs.  It uses Google Test for the unit tests.

Unit Test Requirements:

1. Install Google Test on a Linux build machine:
	http://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/list

2. Create a file called "local.properties" in the
   root/unittests.  local.properties is used
   by the makefile and specifies the path to the
   Google Test directory on the build machine.
   Since local.properties is specific to each build
   system, do not add local.properties to the code repo.

   local.properties should contain GTEST_DIR.
   For example:

   GTEST_DIR := /home/johndoe/utils/gtest-1.7.0

4. To run the unit test, first build the stack.

5. Run the unit test by
   root/unittests/release/tests
