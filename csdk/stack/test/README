stacktests.cpp is a unit test of the APIs in ocstack.c.  
It uses Google Test for the unit tests.  Note that
the unit tests are only to test the functionality of
ocstack.c.  It is not a system or end-to-end test.

Unit Test Requirements:

1. Install Google Test on a Linux build machine
2. Create a file called "local.properties" in the 
   root/csdk/stack/test.  local.properties is used
   by the makefile and specifies the path to the 
   Google Test directory on the build machine.
   Since local.properties is specific to each build
   system, do not add local.properties to the code repo.

   local.properties should contain GTEST_DIR.
   For example:
   

   GTEST_DIR := /home/johndoe/utils/gtest-1.7.0

3. The unit test assumes that the "eth0" interface is
   available.  If not, the unit tests will FAIL.
4. To run the unit test, first build the C OCStack.
   At the time of this writing this was done by running
   
   root/csdk/make deepclean
   root/csdk/make

5. Next, run
   root/csdk/stack/test/make clean
   root/csdk/stack/test/make

6. Run the test by
   root/csdk/stack/test/stacktests
