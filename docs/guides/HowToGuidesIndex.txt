@section GuideBuildStack How to build the stack

This guide will provide instructions on how to build the stack. Instructions provided in this guide are tested against Ubuntu 14.10, however, Ubuntu version 12.0.4 and above are supported.

<b> Build Environment </b>

Boost version 1.55 and G++ are required in order to build the stack. Install boot by running the following command in terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Followed by installing G++ by running the following command in the terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential g++

At this point, your development environment should be setup.

<b> Building </b>

Make sure oic-resource and oic-utilites are checked out in the same directory. Provided your build environment is properly setup, navigate into oic-resource repository using the terminal, which includes the make file needed the build the stack and samples. Run the <i>make</i> command which will build all the necessary components for the stack and the sample applications.

All the compiled executables and libraries will be available in the same directory as the make file on successfully completing the build.
