==                      UB Stack & TB Stack                                  ==
===============================================================================

The OIC-RESOURCE repository contains two SDKs with underlying code
(i.e. "stack"). The two SDKs are referred to as "UB SDK" (or "C++ SDK") and "TB
SDK" (or "C SDK"). The associated stacks are referred to as "UB Stack" (or "C++
Stack") and "TB Stack" (or "C Stack").  The UB Stack requires that the TB Stack
is built under it.

===============================================================================

The UB Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04 operating system.
To build UB Stack, please follow these requirements:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6.1
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.
- The OIC-UTILITIES repository must be a sibling directory to the OIC-RESOURCE
  repository.

The TB Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04, Arduino ATMega 2560 with
Arduino Framework 1.0.5, and Arduino Due with Arduino Framework 1.5.7.
Tip: Use Cutecom in Ubuntu 12.04 to view logs from Arduino ATMega 2560 and
Arduino Due.

To build TB Stack, please follow these requirements for Linux Ubuntu 12.04:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6.1
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.
- The OIC-UTILITIES repository must be a cousin directory to the OIC-RESOURCE
  repository.
To build TB Stack, please follow these requirements for Arduino ATMega 2560:
- AVR-GCC compiler version is 4.5.3
- Unzip the Time Library from here to your Arduino Directory Structure:
  http://playground.arduino.cc/code/time
- The OIC-UTILITIES repository must be a cousin directory to the OIC-RESOURCE
  repository.
- Apply 2 patches from OIC-UTILITIES/tb/ to your Arduino Directory Structure.

At this time, build instructions have not been written for the Arduino ATMega
2560 with WiFi Shield, Arduino Due with Ethernet Shield, and Arduino Due with
WiFi Shield. These instructions will be included very soon (as the build
server(s) verifies and utilizes the new build script "buildScript.mk").

===============================================================================

Instructions for Common Build Processes:

NOTE: 'GNU Make' is required to utilize the build script at location:
<oic-resource>/buildScript.mk.

- All Modules (TB Stack, TB Unit Tests, TB Examples, UB Stack, UB Examples) for
Linux & Arduino Mega 2560:

	make -f buildScript.mk all

- All UB Stack Modules in Release & Debug (TB Stack, UB Stack, UB Examples) for
Linux:

	make -f buildScript.mk linux_ub

- All Modules, without OCICUC, in Release & Debug (TB Stack, TB Unit Tests,
TB Examples, UB Stack, UB Examples) for linux:

	make -f buildScript.mk linux

- All Modules, Including OCICUC, in Release & Debug (TB Stack, TB Unit Tests,
TB Examples, UB Stack, UB Examples, UB OCICUC) for linux:
(This will be what is used on the Build Server(s) to limit regression.)

	make -f buildScript.mk all_dev

- All UB Stack Modules, Including OCICUC, in Release & Debug (TB Stack,
UB Stack, UB Examples, UB OCICUC) for linux:

	make -f buildScript.mk linux_ub_dev

- All TB Stack Modules in Release & Debug (TB Stack, TB Unit Tests,
TB Examples) for Linux:

	make -f buildScript.mk linux_tb

- All TB Stack Modules in Release & Debug (TB Stack, TB Unit Tests,
TB Examples) for Arduino ATMega 2560:

	make -f buildScript.mk arduinomega

- Clean All:

	make -f buildScript.mk clean
